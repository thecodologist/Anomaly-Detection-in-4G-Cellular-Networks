# Anomaly-Detection-in-4G-Cellular-Networks
The goal of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to spot any unusual or unexpected activity within a 4G mobile network. The objective is to uncover any deviations from standard network operations that could indicate security breaches, performance problems, or possible network breakdowns. The dataset utilized for this project is sourced from Kaggle.com, and Matplotlib is employed to evaluate various aspects of the data through data visualization. Various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XG-Boost, are tested and trained to determine the most precise model for identifying anomalies in mobile networks.
